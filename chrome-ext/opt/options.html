			<li>Please make sure you are logged into your <a href="https://www.overdrive.com" target="_blank">www.OverDrive.com</a> account.
				Note that your OverDrive account is not the same as having a card account for each individual library,
				though it will save your library card information to it as you checkout books while logged in.</li>
			<li>You must have saved at least one library in your OverDrive account. To find and save libraries, use
				the "Find a library" link at the top right of the <a href="https://www.overdrive.com" target="_blank">OverDrive</a> website.</li>
			<li>To automatically find the names and websites of your saved libraries, press the Setup button.</li>
			<li>The setup process will take a few seconds as it gathers your saved libraries and attempts
				to determine the correct Overdrive.com (or LibraryReserve.com) web address for searching them.</li>
			<li>Should the setup process not finish in under a minute, press the Cancel Setup button. You may then
				need to find and enter the correct web address manually as described below.</li>
		</ol>
		<button id='btnSetup'>Setup</button>
		<p>You may also enter your library information manually by using the Add and Save buttons below.
			If a web address does not point to a valid library on OverDrive.com or LibraryReserve.com,
			its background will turn red. This means it will not show up in the Multiple Library Search results.</p>
		<p>In a few cases where a library still uses its own domain name for ebooks, the extension
			might not be able to resolve the correct OverDrive.com or LibraryReserve.com address.
		 	To fix such problems: Navigate to the library's OverDrive website in a new browser tab, then copy
			and paste the website address from the location bar of your browser into these options and save.</p>

		<b>About Multiple Library Search</b>
		<p><img src="popup.png" style="float:right; height:240px; margin-left:6px;">
			This extension adds a results box hovering over an OverDrive search or book item page showing
			its availability for all of your saved libraries. Now you can see at a glance which libraries
			have the book available to borrow, how many holds are on how many copies at each library,
			and which libraries might not even own the book. One click takes you directly to a library to borrow it,
			or click elsewhere on the box to shrink or expand it to read the page beneath it.</p>
		<p><img src="MLSresults.png" style="float:left; width:300px; margin-right:7px; vertical-align:bottom">
			This extension also adds a popup button to your chrome toolbar. Use it to quickly search all of your
			OverDrive libraries at once for an ebook or audiobook that you wish to check out.</p>

			Your saved OverDrive libraries are listed in the table above. The library abbreviation is what appears
			in the Multiple Library Search Results box whenever you search your saved libraries from
			<a href="https://www.overdrive.com" target="_blank">www.OverDrive.com</a>.
			The OverDrive web address column points to each library's individual ebook collection on the web.
			The full name of each library (or the library district or library consortium) is in the final column.</p>
		<p>You may edit your library information manually. The Add button adds a blank row for a new library.
			A library may be deleted entirely by clearing all three of its columns, or you may clear just its web
			address to omit it from the Multiple Library Search Results box. No changes take effect until you
			save them. To cancel without saving, just close or reload this options popup.</p>
		<p>If a web address does not point to a valid OverDrive.com (or LibraryReserve.com) website,
			its background will turn red. This means it will not show up in the Multiple Library Search results.
			To rerun setup and try to automatically determine the library information again, you can use the Clear
			&amp; Setup button to the right. This will delete any edits you have made to the list of libraries.</p>
		<p>Note that this extension should also work with those OverDrive libraries that still use
			a LibraryReserve.com web address for their ebook collections.</p>
