# OverDrive-Multiple-Library-Quick-Search
Webform and extension to search multiple OverDrive libraries

This tool submits an OverDrive search and opens the results in a new tab (or a new window, depending on your browser settings). It is designed to be a timesaver for anyone with multiple library cards and multiple libraries to search.

You have the option of showing only eBooks or Audiobooks. To cut down on useless results, it will also try to only show books available in the region OverDrive automagically determines your ip to be in.

This tool's correct operation depends on the stability of OverDrive's URL schema, changes to which are out of the control of the author. Consequently, this search may break at any time.

Tested: 21 May 2019

## Browser extension details

The extension also adds a popup button to your chrome toolbar. Use it to quickly search OverDrive for an ebook or audiobook to check out.

The browser extension adds a results box hovering over an OverDrive search or media item page containing a book's availability for all of your saved libraries. It will let you know at a glance which have the book available to borrow, how many holds on how many copies at each library, and which might not even own the book. Click on the availability to go directly to a library, or click elsewhere on the box to shrink or expand it to read the page beneath it.

Use the extension's options page to setup a list of libraries to search. If you are logged into OverDrive and have a list of saved libraries, the extension can automatically setup those libraries for the multiple library search.
